#### Homework Tasks

1. Programming Explorations:

    - Remember: The point of these exercises is to help you practice programming; I'm looking for curiosity, exploration, and play.  I'm not expecting perfection.
    - Put your code in the appropriate sub-folders in your Dropbox folder:
    - At the top of each `sketch.js`, put a comment block like this:

                // -----------
                // ARTG 2260 - PROGRAMMING BASICS (Thursday)
                // Homework 02 - Exploration XX
                // YOUR NAME
                // DATE
                // -----------
    5. Write **brief** process documentation (don't go overboard... a short paragraph for each exploration is perfect) as a separate `README.txt` in each exploration folder.
        - At the top of the text file, include a text block like this:

                -----------
                ARTG 2260 - PROGRAMMING BASICS (Thursday)
                Homework 02 - Exploration XX
                YOUR NAME
                DATE
                -----------
        - Briefly describe the purpose of the code - what were you trying to do?
        - Explain in a broad sense, how the code works.
        - Describe any issues you had and how you tried to overcome them.
        - For pad and paper sketches, take a photo or scan and add them to the folder.
        - Include any links to code that is not your own. Give credit to the author. Describe how you used this code or how you changed this code.
    
    - Explorations:
        - 01: **Make an interactive music visualizer program! Ex. Draw shapes on screen based on music and have a user's interaction affect the way they draw.**

3. Email me (david@davidnunez.com) when you are done with your explorations and they are in Dropbox.  I will consider the timestamp on that email as the "submitted time." **Even if you only submit a paragraph saying 'I have no idea what I'm doing,' that's much better than submitting nothing at all.**  In your email, write (at least) one question or topic related to the homework you'd like to hear more about in class. (ex. what was the trickiest part; was there anything especially frustrating; was your curiosity piqued about a particular subject we didn't cover in class)?

4. Be ready to discuss your code in class.
