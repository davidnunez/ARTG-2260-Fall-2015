#### Homework Tasks

1. Work through p5.dom "beyond the canvas" tutorial:

	- https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Beyond-the-canvas


1. Programming Explorations:

    - Remember: The point of these exercises is to help you practice programming; I'm looking for curiosity, exploration, and play.  I'm not expecting perfection.
    - Put your code in the appropriate sub-folders in your Dropbox folder:
    - At the top of each `sketch.js`, put a comment block like this:

                // -----------
                // ARTG 2260 - PROGRAMMING BASICS (Thursday)
                // Homework 05 - Exploration XX
                // YOUR NAME
                // DATE
                // -----------
    5. Write **brief** process documentation (don't go overboard... a short paragraph for each exploration is perfect) as a separate `README.txt` in each exploration folder.
        - At the top of the text file, include a text block like this:

                -----------
                ARTG 2260 - PROGRAMMING BASICS (Thursday)
                Homework 05 - Exploration XX
                YOUR NAME
                DATE
                -----------
        - Briefly describe the purpose of the code - what were you trying to do?
        - Explain in a broad sense, how the code works.
        - Describe any issues you had and how you tried to overcome them.
        - For pad and paper sketches, take a photo or scan and add them to the folder.
        - Include any links to code that is not your own. Give credit to the author. Describe how you used this code or how you changed this code.

    - Explorations:
        - 01: **Create a p5 sketch (using p5.dom) that introduces an HTML form into one of your previous homework (or something brand new if you are ambitions).  For example, you can iterate on your drawing machine from exploration 03. Give your user some more options using things like buttons and dropdown menus to influence the generative art created with your drawing machine.**

3. Email me (david@davidnunez.com) when you are done with your explorations and they are in Dropbox.  I will consider the timestamp on that email as the "submitted time." **Even if you only submit a paragraph saying 'I have no idea what I'm doing,' that's much better than submitting nothing at all.**  In your email, write (at least) one question or topic related to the homework you'd like to hear more about in class. (ex. what was the trickiest part; was there anything especially frustrating; was your curiosity piqued about a particular subject we didn't cover in class)?

4. Be ready to discuss your code in class.
